# PROJECTS

We will have all of our projects here under the files and we will name them accordingly.We made a menu that allows you to pick what you want to open and run

## Scrum group Members

Lola Bulkin - Scrum Master
Brayden Basinger, Grace Le, Billy Cherres, Ryan Moghaddas

### What we do

We will practice the 4 C's and work together. We will collaborate with every project here, and we help each other in our Python playgrounds

# Project 1 - Number Guessing game

Select option 1 to open number guessing game

## How to play

You guess a number 1-20 and you have 3 guesses to try to guess the secret number

## How we made this game

### What pictures did we incorporate 

We have 3 prizes that corrolate with how many guesses it takes you to guess the right number. We also addded colors to go along with this to make the game more appealing

### What did we use

We the try function in this game in case of the user inputting a wrong input. If we say input a number and they accidentaly put in a letter, the game will tell you to retry. This is important because user error is common and we wanted a way to fix this. We also used the rand.int function to generate the random number within our range 

#### Algos and Programming - Strings, Numbers
We used these in almost everything. All of our projects have these. For example we added numbers in the menu and we added strings in lots or our code
#### Algos and Programming - Variables and Assignments
We used these in most projects. For example we assigned number_1 = 6 and when we want to call in a certian thing, we can use a variable. These variables and assignments made the code more consise and easier to read. We used variables and assignments in many ways to make the code better
#### Algos and Programming - Lists, Dictionaries
We used a dictionary in the guess the number game to assign data values. Lists in the word guess game. We used lists and dictionaries, but not as frequently as strings. We used a dictionary once in the guess the number game. We used lists in the word guess game. 
#### Algos and Programming - Iteration
We used iterations in the code with loops in the calculator game
#### Algos and Programming - Functions
We used the try function in the number guessing game. We will work on adding more functions to the code. We read up on some websites on how to use different functions. 



### What was the WOW factor

The wow factor was defidently the picture of the game. We added the picture of the word at the beginning of the game and it was really cool. We also added a firework effect this week, which is a main WOW factor and makes our game one-of-a-kind.

### What did everyone do

- Brayden - I put the Rand.int function in here to generate the random number. I added some colors to the project to make it more lively. I did this README.md and made it look good. I added the menu where you can pick what you want to do as well.
- Grace - I was able to debug any issues that came up during both the projects. Using syntax I was able to find what was wrong with the project such as indentation or if the input values were wrong. Those were some of the issues that our group collided with and had to solve
- Lola - I was able to look over our number guessing game and incorporate the user input questions that guide the user through the game. I also helped Brayden think of our game ideas, like guessing hangman letters and incorporating a calculator as one of our options.
- Billy - I was able to debug some minor indentation errors. I added comments to the project making it easier to navigate the code. I also created if statements and was able to add color to parts ryan didn't add color too to further improve the game. I also added to the ReadMe to show how our code aligned with the AP recuirements.
- Ryan - I added color to the game to make it more appealing and interesting. I spent time going through the AP alignment and explained how our project is a great representation of what is shown in the course exam and description for this class.

## What we learned

We learned how to use many function and how to do if/else statements. We learned how to communicate effectievly during this project and how to work as a team

## How we can improve

- We can always make the code more concise
- We could incorporate more functions 
- We could add some more advanced elements of Python

## AP Alignment

This project covers a lot of what is shown in the course exam and description for this class because it follows the preparation and completetion performance task directions. As we prepared, we brainstormed ideas, practice and discussed individual and group tasks, reviewed the scoring guidelines and how our work will be assesed, reviewed examples of perfomance task submissions, read through the AP digital portfolio file submission requirements and process, practiced creating a PDF file of the code to submit, and understood that after submission, nothing could be changed. While completeing the project, we followed and created a schedule that provides times for completeing all parts of the project, applied the knowlegde we learned throughout the course to our project, added comments to our code to clarify the funcitonality our program code, worked on the project outside of school time, kept a programing journal, and did not submit any work that had been created by someone else outside of our group. As for the content of the code, it has the following; strings, numbers, functions, iterations, variables, assignments, lists, and dictionaries. This is important because the code aligns with the AP requirements.


# Project 2 - Word Guess

Select option 2 to open word guess game

## How to play

Select option 2 to open word guess game. You guess a word letter by letter and untill you get the word correct, and win a prize.

# Project 3 - Calculator

Select option 3 to open the calculator

## How to play

Select option 3 to open the calculator. Chose which function you want, then enter the numbers you want to calculate.

## How we can improve

When you use the power function, and you input the number 0, you get an error. We need to fix this float function so that when you put 0 is just says 1.
